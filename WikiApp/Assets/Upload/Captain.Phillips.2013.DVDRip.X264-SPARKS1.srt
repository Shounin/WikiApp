Yeah.

4
00:01:56,983 --> 00:02:00,897
You'd think these trips would get easier,
but it's just the opposite.

5
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,332
Well, I feel the same way, Ange.

6
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,765
I know this is what we do.
This is our life.

7
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,604
But it just seems like the world
is moving so

8
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:18,508
...and right now
things are changing so much.

9
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,618

doesn't take school seriously.

15
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:44,472
Him missing class.
That could come out-

16
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:48,010
It might hurt him when he's out
looking for a job, you know?

00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:55,056
I want to search the ship.

514
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:58,591
You wanna search the ship?

515
00:46:58,749 --> 00:47:03,960
I want to search every lock and hold
of the ship now.

516
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:05,794
- You wanna search the ship?
- Now.

517
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:07,993
All right. We'll search the ship.

518
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:10,798
We'll shirt on the nav deck
and work our way down.

00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:29,514
All right? All right. awd-

00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:42,737
All right. Okay.

Go.

528
00:47:47,431 --> 00:47:49,934
Geﬂa get these lights off.
They're gonna see us.

529
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,876
We need to shut down the generator
on the main deck.

530
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,038
- You think you can get up there?
- Yeah.

531
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:58,947
I'm gonna go lo lhe mess, get water.
Get everyone on lhe lower level.

532
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:01,043
All right. I'm on 2.

533
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:01,385


534
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:11,289
Just shirt at the very top.

535
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,834
This is E deck.

536
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:18,371
And we'll just work our way down
one by one, huh?

537
00:48:38,482 --> 00:48:42,191
Cargo hold is probably where they are.
There's a lot of places to hide.

538
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:44,025
And I'm not ﬂying to trick you.

539
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:47,430
I wanna find these gum
just as much as you do.

540
00:48:48,558 --> 00:48:50,435
Take his ﬂashlight.

541
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:57,209
We should just move on,
because we're wasting time here.

542
00:48:57,367 --> 00:49:00,541
Like I say,
the cargo decks the best place to look.

543
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,179
Somebody messing with ship.

544
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,357
Engine room.

545
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:14,962
If we're going about this swtemafically,
we shined at the top...

546
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:18,759
...we're working our way down,
so we should 11y the cargo deck.

547
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:22,826
Problem from engine room.

548
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,440
We go there now.

549
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:27,871
All right. Engine room.

550
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:29,942
It's gonna be really hut down there.

551
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,081
Wilhout the power on,
there's no venfilafion, no air.

552
00:49:33,236 --> 00:49:37,548
Maybe we should get some water
from the mess down on A deck?

553
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:46,453
- Then engine room. Go.
- Okay.

554
00:49:57,294 --> 00:49:59,171
This is A deck.

555
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:10,752
So here we are.

556
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:14,783
This is the galley.

557
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:21,123
This is where we make the food.

558
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:35,104
All right. Here, some water.

559
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:40,607
Check this room.

560
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,913
Oh, you wanna see in here?
This is cold storage.

561
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,316
It's a vegetable room.

562
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:55,062
Careful in here in the bare feet.

563
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:58,528
You could cut them
on almost anylhing.

564
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:03,963
Want some of this melon?
It's left over from breakfast.

565
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:06,971
It's just gonna go bad.
It's just gonna spoil.

566
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:10,705
It's usually left out
for the first meal of the day.

567
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:14,246
Maybe we should-
Go ahead, help yourself. Here you go.

568
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:17,715
Help yourself.
It's usually for breakfast, but...

569
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:28,696
Enough. Engine room.

570
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:30,456
All right.

571
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:53,383
- Cronan. Cronan. Do you read?
- Yeah, I got you.

00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:01,555
Is there glass you can break,
leave on the ﬂoor by the dool?

575
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:05,063
I'll do it. Come on, let's go. Come on.

576
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:40,599
Here's the engine room.

577
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:45,838
On, my God.

578
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:48,532
Look out. There's broken glass.
Be careful.

579
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:51,770
- Put your hand up. Up your hands. Up.
- Okay, all fight.

580
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:53,312
Up.

581
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:57,416
- There's a first-aid kit-
- Put your hands up!

582
00:52:57,574 --> 00:53:02,080
- Who did this?
- Nobody. It was just a dumb accident.

583
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:05,590
We should get that looked at.
There's a kit in the oonhol room.

584
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:08,662
Quiet, Irish. You think I m stupid?

585
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:10,456
I know what's going on.

586
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:14,864
We're going to search this whole room.
All of it. Now go.

587
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,463
Go.

588
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:41,019

590
00:54:02,806 --> 00:54:05,184
There's no one here.

591
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,515
Please, let's go back.

592
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:18,127
Go. Right down to the boltom. Now.

593

- We just-
- Look at me, Irish. Look at me.

598
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:23,463
What's wrong with your ship?

599
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,497
- I don't know.
- Was that you?

600
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:27,566
- I don't know what went wrong.
- No.

601
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:31,501
You'll never find this crew,
not without any power on the ship.

602
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:34,198
You'll never find them.
We'll never find them.

603
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:36,735

604
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,007
